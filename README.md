# 20TIME-Assembly
This is a Honors ELA project for the 8 weeks where 20% of the week is dedicated to our own intrests and the whole point is to either learn something new of the student's choosing or produce a product.

Question:
<span style='color: red;'> What are the most effective ways for beginners to learn assembly language and code assembly in higher level languages? </span>

-I chose to code learn how to make low level code with assembly. <br>
-The reason I chose this is because I want to make shellcode, which is raw binary that is usually injected into a process. <br>
-Shellcode is very popular in<span style='color: red;'> malware! </span> because the raw bytes can be encrypted and the injection process is very stealthy from antivirus(AV) static analysis (the malicious payload is encrypted, AVs cannot determine what it does). <br>
-Antiviruses also have a very hard time determining what this low level code does if its encoded/setup correctly. <br>

-This form of attack is might be older and less popular than DLL injectior but its still as powerfull. <br>

-Bad part is that assembly is easy to write but hard to understand. This is why the second part of my question asks how to use higher level languages to generate assembly code. Preferably Rust due to its memory safety or C because of its simplicity. <br>

-Scope of this project is to learn some assembly first and try out programs and then switch over to coding assembly programs in Rust or C. (I may get into actually making <b> <u> malicious </u> </b> shellcode) <br>
