# Week 5 Relfection
This week has been full. I have stumbled upon how to do loops and functions take place in assembly and I have experimented greatly with these.
I see that in assembly loops have to be taken care of more. You need to keep track of the iterations, otherwise the program will run forever which is not good. That is all for this week, nothing much.
