# <b> Week 2 Reflection <br> </b>
Well its the second week, and I have made some good progress. I have finished the some assembly required guide but I was
disappointed that it was so short. Fortunatelly I went to the summon database and found a variety of big books that could help me learn more.
I realized that if I wanted to achieve any good progress for the project, I needed to start producing a product.
This is where this new book is gonna come in. Its big book on the full basics for noobs. I chose it out of all others because I perfectly matched my terms.
I wanted a book that guided me though specifically bare x86 assembly for the linux kernel. It uses the AT&T syntax which the GNU Assembler is made for so I has to switch from NASM to that.

I have been reading that book for about 2 days now and its going good. I plan to actually program next week and experiment with sample code too.
