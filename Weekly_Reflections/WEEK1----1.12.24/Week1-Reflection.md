# Week 1 Reflection
This week on 1/12/24 I mainly setup the github page and revised the website design drastically. I mainly struggled to understand how I should go about carrying out this project during class because there is a lot to do. I thought about making my own website, with a custom domain because the simple and convenient google site builder was too simple and limited but realized it would be too much. Now I better understand how to carry out this project after reading the intructions repeatedly.
Real work starts next week as I will start reading this [Open Source Assembly Course](https://github.com/hackclub/some-assembly-required/tree/main) and learning about some of the computing concepts like virtual memory with this [Paper](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/amp/). I needed to setup the NASM compiler for any code to compile, and I did that quickly. I belive I am on the research of the design processs as I am starting to do research on this language now.
