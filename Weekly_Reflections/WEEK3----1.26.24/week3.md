# Week 3 Reflection
This week was a bit slow, I am still reading the book and have reached the fun section where real coding starts.
I learn about the basic program structure and boilerplate code with is needed in every case. i learnd some operands like ```movq```
which move a quadword value (64-bit number, basicly between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) and about different
registers and what a syscall does. I am currently on page 31 of the book. I plan this weekend to keep on reading while looking at more code samples online.
