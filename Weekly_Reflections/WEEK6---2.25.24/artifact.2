### Initialize Registers ###
# Put the number of elements of the array in %rcx
movq numberofnumbers, %rcx
# Put the *address* of the first element in %rbx
movq $mynumbers, %rbx
# Use %rdi to hold the current-high value
movq $0, %rdi
### Check Preconditions ###
# If there are no numbers, stop
cmp $0, %rcx
je endloop
### Main Loop ###
myloop:
# Get the next value (currently pointed to by %rbx)
movq (%rbx), %rax
# If it is not bigger, go to the end of the loop
cmp %rdi, %rax
jbe loopcontrol
# Otherwise, store this as the biggest element so far
movq %rax, %rdi
loopcontrol:
# Change the address in %rbx to point to the next value
addq $8, %rbx
# Decrement %rcx and keep going until %rcx is zero
loopq myloop
### Cleanup and Exit ###
endloop:
# We're done - exit
