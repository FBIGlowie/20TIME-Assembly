# Week 6 Relfection
This week was cut short a little bit. I still amnaged to experiment some more with this language after looking up more tutorials.
I also got a understant about how the memory works at compile time. previously I thought this was very complex but it turned out to be simple
arithmetic math. I also can create and scoll though lists in assembly. I have also realized why higher level language exist. A simple loop that
checks items in a array is a lot more complicated and error prone in assembly. You have to think like the computer. I continued reading the book and I'm wondering if I should skip
a chapter and to go to the operating systems basics chapter.
